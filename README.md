# ExpressVPN Toggler

An Android app for quickly toggling VPN settings when connected to an ExpressVPN router.

The app was written using Flutter, and could easily be built for iOS. If you'd find that helpful, 
let me know by creating a new Issue.

As a JavaScript dev, I found it remarkably easy to get started with Dart--it felt kind of like 
working with ES6.
